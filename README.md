this is a practice in a basic understanding of accessing objects and basic database

on the loading of windows, 

the user is presented with a temporary screen displaying a button that 
says "start quiz".

a object has all the question, each assigned to an array of answers. ag
( var question 1 {
"question": " what is the capital of England?",
answers:"["Russia","richmond, "Fairfax", "Baltimore"],"correct annswer":"Russia"}

question.textvalue=question[i]
})
an object has all the answers 

on click, the screen wipes away to the right and becomes hidden. 
triggers the first set of questions.{
    object(first question is called)
    


}
